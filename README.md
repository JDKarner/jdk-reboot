# jdk-reboot

This relies on windows sudo for at least reboot-firmware.
gsudo may be able to be used on older versions of windows.


Build or install with my release .exe, once the files are indexed you can just type reboot, reboot-firmware, or hibernate into windows search rather than reaching for your mouse.
